# Project Summary

This project includes several small pieces of functionality.  We will be testing all of them!  Remember that to set up your testing, you can:

1. Copy and paste an existing `nightwatch.conf.js` and `nightwatchProps.js`
2. Write a new `nightwatch.conf.js`, following the specs on nightwatchjs.org
3. Create your test framework, usually a "tests" or "nightwatch" folder in the repository's base directory, and testing/resource folders inside of that
4. Plan WHAT should be tested
5. Plan HOW you can test this
6. Figure out what information you'll need (test data)
7. Are there frequently used functions you can break out into their own?
8. Start writing!  Write your tests in plain English first, and then go to code

## Functionality

### Odds and Evens

This field will take a string of numbers and sort them into odd and even outputs.

### Filter Object

These objects can be filtered by entering any of their properties.  Only objects with that property will appear in the results.

### Filter String

From the listed strings, only those containing the string you input will appear in the results.

### Palindrome

Click the button to see whether the string you entered is, or is not, a palindrome.

### Sum

On the input lines, put in two numbers, click the button to see their sum.

## Contributions

If you see a problem or a typo, please fork, make the necessary changes, and create a pull request so we can review your changes and merge them into the master repo and branch.
